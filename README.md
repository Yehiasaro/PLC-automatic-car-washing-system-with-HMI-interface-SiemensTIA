Automated Car Washing System with HMI Interface
 
This repository contains the code and documentation for an automated car washing system equipped with a Human-Machine Interface (HMI), developed using Siemens TIA Portal v18. The system is designed to streamline the car washing process by incorporating features such as car detection, sequential washing stages, sensor control, conveyor motor operation, and additional device activation for efficient and thorough car cleaning.

System Description:

The automated car washing process consists of several sequential stages, including car detection, washing, brushing, rinsing, drying, sensor control, continuous car movement with the conveyor motor, and activation of additional devices. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

- Car Detection: The system incorporates sensors to detect the presence of cars entering the washing area, initiating the automated cleaning process.

- Sequential Washing Stages: The washing process is divided into sequential stages, including washing, brushing, rinsing, and drying, ensuring thorough cleaning of the car.

- Sensor Control: Sensors are utilized to monitor various parameters such as water level, soap level, and car position, enabling precise control and adjustment of the washing process.

- Conveyor Motor Operation: A conveyor motor is employed to facilitate continuous movement of the car through the washing stages, ensuring efficient and timely cleaning.

- Additional Device Activation: The system activates additional devices such as soap dispensers, brushes, and water jets at appropriate stages of the washing process to enhance cleaning effectiveness.

- Car Exit: Upon completion of the washing process, the system guides the car through the exit, signaling the end of the automated car washing cycle.

This automated car washing system offers a seamless and efficient solution for car cleaning, with the integration of an HMI interface providing user-friendly control and monitoring capabilities. Developed using Siemens TIA Portal v18, the system ensures reliability, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
